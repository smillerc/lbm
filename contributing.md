## Coding Conventions

`snake_case` only

When doing formulas, use `associate` blocks. Variable names are english, but formulas use the classic short variable

force = mass * acceleration becomes f = m * a inside of an associate block 


Modules 

Modules that contain a type - `mod_new_type` in `new_type.f90`
